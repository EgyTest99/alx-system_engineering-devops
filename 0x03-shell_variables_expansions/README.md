# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows you to interact with the operating system. It is a program that reads commands from the user and executes them. The shell is the primary way that users interact with Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS.

## Init files

Init files are files that are executed when you log into a computer. They are typically used to set up the environment for your user account, such as setting the path to your home directory and loading your favorite programs.

## Variables

Variables are placeholders for values that can be used in commands. For example, you can create a variable called name and assign it the value John Doe. You can then use the variable name in commands, such as echo <span class="math-inline">name\ which will print the value of the variable `name`.

## Expansions

Expansions are a way of substituting values for variables in commands. For example, you can use the `{variable}syntax to substitute the value of the variablevariablein a command. For example, the commandecho ${name}will print the value of the variablename`.
