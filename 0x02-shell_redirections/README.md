# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

Bash scripting refers to the practice of writing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) programming language. Bash is a widely used shell on Unix-based systems, and it provides powerful scripting capabilities to automate tasks, run commands, and perform various operations.

## Writing a Bash Script

To create a Bash script, follow these steps:

- Open a text editor and create a new file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., script.sh).
- Begin the script with a shebang ( `#!/bin/bash` ) to specify the shell interpreter.
- Write the desired commands and logic in the script using Bash syntax.
- Save the file and make it executable using the `chmod +x script.sh` command.
